# Key Generator
This is a simple example of a key generator made in python. This allows you to generate and use keys. When you use a key, it checks to see if its already used aswell which makes this even cooler. The key generation isnt to complex but still shouldnt be able to be cracked to easily. Well, thats it, you can implement this into what ever you want and it should be secure enough as long as you dont giveaway your keys file lol.
# Help
If you get an error saying "Module not found", type "pip install string", "pip install replit", "pip install random", "pip install hashlib"
